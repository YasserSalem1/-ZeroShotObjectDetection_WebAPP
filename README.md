# -ZeroShotObjectDetection_WebAPP
The goal of this project is to create a web application that incorporates a ZeroShotObjectDetection pretrained model and provides users with a processed image containing bounding boxes around detected objects. The application should be built using a web framework that supports server-side processing, such as Flask.
